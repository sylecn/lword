the lword project

lword helps you memorize new words.

you are asked to spell each new word defined in a word-file.

the word-file is a simple text file.
format is:
<word>
<explainations, hints> without empty newline between them.
<newline>
<word>
<explainations, hints> without empty newline between them.
<newline>
...

----start sample word file----
fahrenheit
/ˈfarənˌhīt/
the temperature scale starts in F

celsius
/ˈselsēəs/
the temperature scale starts in C

----end sample word file----

lword will have a db about which words you already known very well and which
words you constantly make mistakes on.

it also re-prompt old memorized word to you according to the famous the
forgetting curve [1].



* the forgetting curve
一般记住后，在5分钟后重复一遍，20分钟后再重复一遍，1小时后，12小时后，1天后，2
天后，5天后，8天后，14天后就会记得很牢。

** phonemic symbols in words file
   to show KK(Kenyon and Knott) phonemic symbols / IPA(International Phonetic
   Alphabet), you need a good font.

   Lucida Sans Unicode is said to support IPA.

   The IPA-SAM fonts are proprietary copyrighted Encore fonts created using
   Typecaster software supplied by the Summer Institute of Linguistics.

** db design

   | word          | string    | the word                                   |
   |               |           |                                            |
   | count         | int       | how many times the user has typed the word |
   | wrong_count   | int       | how many times the user got it wrong       |
   |               |           |                                            |
   | session_count | int       | how many sessions has this word mentioned? |
   | last_session  | timestamp | when is last session                       |

** sqlite
   you can run sqlite in script like this
       sqlite3 ex1 'select * from tbl1'
   syntax:
       sqlite3 <db-file-name> <SQL-statement>

* I miss Javscript list and object notation now that I'm writing python code
